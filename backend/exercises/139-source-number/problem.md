# Source Number

Consider a positive integer N. For example, N = 836, the sum M = 836 + 8 + 3 + 6 = 853.  
In this case, we call N = 836 the source number of M = 853.  
Some numbers may have multiple sources, e.g., M = 909 has two source numbers: 891 and 900.

Given a number M (M ≤ 2*10^9), find its source number.  
If M has multiple source numbers, return the smallest one.

## Input
A positive integer M

## Output
The smallest source number of M. If no source number exists, output -1.
