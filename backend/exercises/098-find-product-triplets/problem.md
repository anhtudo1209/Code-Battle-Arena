# Find product triplets

Given an array of natural numbers, find all triplets (a, b, c) where one number is the product of the two other numbers (i.e., a = b x c, b = a x c, or c = a x b). Implement the code to solve this problem using Iteration.

## Input
An array of natural numbers

## Output
Find all triplets (a, b, c) where one number is the product of the two other numbers

## Sample Input
9
4 15 45 9 40 27 3 5 10



## Sample Output
(15, 3, 5) (45, 9, 5) (40, 4, 10) (27, 9, 3) (45, 15, 3)
