# Robot Classification

In an automated laboratory, researchers are studying and building several types of robots. There are three types of robots:

- Type 1: At least 3 antennas and at most 4 cameras  
- Type 2: At most 6 antennas and at least 2 cameras  
- Type 3: At most 2 antennas and at most 3 cameras  

Given a robot, you are provided with the number of antennas and cameras it has. Determine which type(s) the robot may belong to.

## Input
Two positive integers A and C representing the number of antennas and cameras of a robot

## Output
Print the type(s) of the robot in ascending order. If no type matches, print 0.
