# Homework Tasks

An has N homework problems, each with a difficulty level a[i].  
To solve problem i, An must have a skill level ≥ a[i].  
Whenever An solves a problem with difficulty a[i], his skill increases by a[i].  
Initially, An’s skill level is S.

Determine the maximum number of problems An can solve.

## Input
- Line 1: two integers N and S (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, S ≤ 1000)
- Line 2: N integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[N]

## Output
- A single integer: the maximum number of problems An can solve

## Sample Input
5 2  
18 2 5 14 3

## Sample Output
3
