# Three Pieces Game

The game is played as follows: On a number line representing integer points, place three pieces at integer positions A, B, C. Two players take turns. On each turn, a player picks up a piece on the outside and places it at an integer position between the other two pieces (the piece cannot be placed at a position already occupied). The game ends when the three pieces stand consecutively. 

Determine the maximum number of moves that can be played before the game ends.
