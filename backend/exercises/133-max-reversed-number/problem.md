# Max Reversed Number 

Mom asked Ty to teach his younger brother To math, getting him familiar with numbers. Ty noticed his brother was quite intelligent, so comparing numbers in the normal way seemed too simple. Therefore, Ty introduced a new requirement: while regular numbers are read from left to right, these numbers will now be read in reverse - reading the digits from right to left.

Ty's final request is: given two distinct positive integers A and B (1 <= A, B <= 10^9), output the number that has the greater value when read according to the new rule.

## Input
Two distinct positive integers A and B on the same line.

## Output
Print the number with the greater value (according to the new rule).

## Sample Input
734 893

## Sample Output
437
