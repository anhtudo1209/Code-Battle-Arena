# Frequency Count

Given a sequence of N integers A1, A2, ..., AN,  
the frequency of a number is the number of times it appears in the sequence.

Your task is to output the frequency of each distinct number in increasing order of value.

## Input
- Line 1: the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000)  
- Line 2: N integers A1, A2, ..., AN (−100 ≤ Ai ≤ 100)

## Output
- For each distinct number in increasing order, output the number and its frequency

## Sample Input
10  
1 -1 2 7 2 2 -1 3 7 7

## Sample Output
-1 2  
1 1  
2 3  
3 1  
7 3
