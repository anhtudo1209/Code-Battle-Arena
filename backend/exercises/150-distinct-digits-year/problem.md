# Distinct Digits Year

As you know, the year 2013 was the first year after 1987 in which all of its digits were pairwise distinct.

Given an integer N, your task is to find the smallest year strictly greater than N such that all of its digits are pairwise distinct (all digits are unique).

## Input
A single line containing a positive 4-digit integer N (i.e., 1000 <= N <= 9999).
The input value N is guaranteed to always have an answer.

## Output
The smallest positive integer strictly greater than N such that all of its digits are pairwise distinct. The result is guaranteed to be a 4-digit number.
