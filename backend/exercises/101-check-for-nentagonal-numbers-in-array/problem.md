# Rotate Image

Given an array of numbers, write pseudo-code using Recursion (if necessary, Iteration) to check all values in the array to determine if they are pentagonal numbers. A pentagonal number is calculated by the formula: f(n) = {3n^2 - n}/{2}. After writing the pseudo-code, write a program in C/C++ to complete the algorithm.

## Input
An array of numbers

## Output
Check all values in the array to determine if they are pentagonal numbers

## Sample Input
6
1 5 12 10 2 20

## Sample Output
1 5 12
