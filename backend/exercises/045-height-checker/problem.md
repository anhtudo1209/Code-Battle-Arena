# Height Checker

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).


## Input
The input consists of an integer n, representing the number of students,
followed by n integers representing the current heights of the students in line.

## Output
Number of students not in the correct position.
