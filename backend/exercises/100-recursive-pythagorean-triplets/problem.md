# Rotate Image

Given an array of integers, write pseudo-code using Recursion to find all Pythagorean triplets (a, b, c) where a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Then, write a program in C/C++ to complete your proposed algorithm.

## Input
An N x N 2D matrix

## Output
Rotates the image by 90 degrees clockwise in-place

## Sample Input
12
4 15 28 45 40 9 53 41 8 17 3 5



## Sample Output
3, 4, 5 
8, 15, 17
9, 40, 41
28, 45, 53
