# Arithmetic Sequence

An arithmetic sequence is an increasing sequence in which each number after the first is greater than the previous number by a value d, called the common difference.  

Examples:  
- 1 4 7 10 is an arithmetic sequence of 4 numbers with common difference 3  
- 2 6 10 14 18 is an arithmetic sequence of 5 numbers with common difference 4  
- 3 5 7 10 is not an arithmetic sequence of 4 numbers because 7 – 5 ≠ 10 – 7  

During a math test, Ty found the answer to a problem consisting of 4 numbers forming an arithmetic sequence. Teo, sitting nearby, wanted to play a prank. Taking advantage of Ty's distraction, Teo erased one number and wrote back only 3 numbers, not in the original order.  

Ty noticed a number was missing and asked you to help recover the missing number.

## Input
Three integers (with absolute value less than 1000) written on a single line.  
It is guaranteed that there is always a solution.

## Output
Print the missing number in the arithmetic sequence.  
If there are multiple possible answers, print the largest one.

## Sample Input
4 6 8
