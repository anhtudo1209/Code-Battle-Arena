# Rotate Image

Given a positive natural number N, implement two recursive code algorithms to count the number of odd and even digits of N (one function for odd, one function for even)

## Input
An N x N 2D matrix

## Output
Rotates the image by 90 degrees clockwise in-place

## Sample Input
3450


## Sample Output
Odd: 2
Even: 2
