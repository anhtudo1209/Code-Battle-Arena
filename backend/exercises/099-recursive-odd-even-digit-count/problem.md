# Recursive odd even digit count

Given a positive natural number N, implement two recursive code algorithms to count the number of odd and even digits of N (one function for odd, one function for even)

## Input
A positive natural number N

## Output
Two recursive code algorithms to count the number of odd and even digits of N

## Sample Input
3450


## Sample Output
Odd: 2
Even: 2
