# Abundant Number

Today, the teacher just taught Ty about abundant numbers. A number N is called an **abundant number** if N is less than the sum of its divisors (excluding N itself).

Example: N = 12 has 5 divisors excluding itself: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. We see that N = 12 < 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, so N is an abundant number.

Ty challenges his two younger siblings, To and Tet, to check whether a number N is an abundant number.

Help To and Tet solve Ty's problem.

## Input
