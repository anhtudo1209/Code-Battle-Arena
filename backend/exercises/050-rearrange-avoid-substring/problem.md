# Rearrange to Avoid Substring

It is known that a contest can be represented by a string s, consisting of uppercase Latin letters that denote problems. It is also known that a contest is difficult if it contains "FFT" or "NTT" as a contiguous substring. Your task is to rearrange the problem in contests in such a way that this contest is not difficult.

## Input
A string 

## Output
The rearranged string that avoids "FFT" or "NTT" as substrings.

## Sample Input
FFT

## Sample Output
FTF
