# Gas Station

Write a function int canCompleteCircuit(int *gas, int *cost, int size) that takes two arrays. gas[i] is the amount of gas at station i, and cost[i] is the cost to travel from station i to i+1. Find the starting station's index if you can travel around the entire circuit once. If no solution exists, return -1.

## Input
Line 1: the size of the 2 arrays
Line 2 and 3: the arrays

## Output
Find the starting station's index if you can travel around the entire circuit once. If no solution exists, return -1.

## Sample Input
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5 1 2

## Sample Output
3
