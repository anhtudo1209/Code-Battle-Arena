# Friendly Numbers

A pair of positive integers is called friendly numbers if the sum of the proper divisors of each number equals the other number.  
Example: 220 and 284 are friendly numbers because:  
The sum of the divisors of 220 is 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110 = 284  
The sum of the divisors of 284 is 1+2+4+71+142 = 220  

Similarly, 1184 and 1210 are also friendly numbers.  

Write a program to check whether two given numbers are friendly numbers.

## Input
Two positive integers a and b separated by a space (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5)

## Output
Print "YES" if a and b are friendly numbers; otherwise print "NO"

## Sample Input
220 284

## Sample Output
YES

## Sample Input
12 20
