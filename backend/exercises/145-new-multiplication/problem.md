# New Multiplication

An invented a new way of multiplying two numbers A and B.  
Instead of performing the usual multiplication, he multiplies each digit of A with each digit of B, then sums all these products.

Example: The result of 123 * 45 is:  
1*4 + 1*5 + 2*4 + 2*5 + 3*4 + 3*5 = 54

Given two positive integers A and B, compute the value of A*B according to An's multiplication method.

## Input
Two positive integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^9)

## Output
Print the result of the multiplication according to An's method

## Sample Input
123 45

## Sample Output
54
