# Find Co-Prime Pairs using Linked List ADT

Given an array of integers, find all co-prime pairs using **Linked List ADT**.

Two integers are co-prime if their **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) is 1**.

**Constraint**
- Each element of the array **must be stored as a node in a Linked List**
- You must solve the problem using **Linked List principles**
- Direct array-based solutions are not allowed

## Input
An integer n  
n integers

## Output
Print all co-prime pairs in the format:

(a, b)

## Sample Input
4  
2 7 5 10

## Sample Output
(2, 7) (2, 5) (7, 5) (7, 10) (5, 10)
