# Next Day

Given a date d, t, n representing day, month, and year, determine the date of the next day.

## Input
Three integers d, t, n separated by spaces representing day, month, and year (1 ≤ d ≤ 31, 1 ≤ t ≤ 12, 0 ≤ n ≤ 9999).  
The input is guaranteed to be a valid date (for example, 31 2 2014 is invalid).

## Output
Print the day, month, and year of the next day, separated by spaces. Do not print leading zeros for day or month.  
Leap years should be considered:  
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400, or divisible by 4 but not by 100.

## Sample Input
1 1 2014

## Sample Output
2 1 2014

## Sample Input
31 1 2014

## Sample Output
1 2 2014
