# Real Number Sequence

Given a sequence of N real numbers. Perform the following calculations:
1. Compute the **total sum** of the sequence.
2. Compute the **sum of all negative numbers**.
3. Compute the **sum of all positive numbers**.
4. Compute the **sum of numbers at even indices** (or positions).
5. Compute the **sum of numbers at odd indices** (or positions).

## Input
Line 1: A single positive integer N (1 <= N <= 100).
Line 2: N real numbers a1, a2, ..., aN.

## Output
Line 1: The results of the five calculations in the following order: total sum, sum of negative numbers, sum of positive numbers, sum of numbers at even positions, sum of numbers at odd positions. The values should be separated by a space and formatted to **two decimal places**.

## Sample Input
5
-1.00 4.00 -3.00 2.00 5.00

## Sample Output
7.00 -4.00 11.00 6.00 1.00
